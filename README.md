**User Story:**

An Indian pharmaceutical X (~4,000 employees), has observed an annual attrition rate of 15% in 2015, a figure significantly impacting operational efficiency and organizational continuity. The company engaged a professional data analytics firm to uncover the root causes and identify actionable insights to address the issue.

FYI: In human resources, attrition is the gradual reduction in an organization's workforce due to employees leaving for any reason. 

**Data preprocessing & Modelling**

Use Python & Power Querie Editor to preprocess and modelling data. Performed simple machine learning (Logistic regression) to predict attrition rate (y) base on model features (x), then evaluate the importance of each attribute (reason) contributing to employee attrition.

Based on the model's analysis of attribute importance, derive the top 3 hypotheses explaining why employees leave the company:

- Work-Life Balance: Long working hours and frequent overtime.
- Job Satisfaction: Low satisfaction with job roles or responsibilities.
- Workplace Environment: Challenges related to the overall work environment and conditions.
